This will be my only Facebook rant, because I am just fed up with experiencing this and I'm sure as hell im not the only one. \n\nIf someone (guy or girl) doesn't want to give you their number, RESPECT THAT. There are many reasons why they may not feel secure or want to give their number out. I get it, its rejection, but at least it's decent rejection. Rather than giving you a fake number and getting our hopes up and ending up embarrassing and humiliating you.\n\nIf someone (guy or girl) doesn't want to go on a date with you, RESPECT THAT. There are many reasons why they may not feel okay with a date right now. Again, rejection sucks. But at least it's not being humiliated by them saying yes, you spending the money on this date, them leading you on, and then them going back to their ex a week later.\n\nIf someone (guy or girl) doesn't want to accept your drink at a bar, RESPECT THAT. Maybe their significant other wouldn't appreciate that. Maybe they've had a bad experience about accepting drinks at a bar. Or maybe they simply just want to stick to drinking with the people they came with and not have to worry about strangers handing them drinks.\n\nIf someone (guy or girl) doesn't want to dance with you, RESPECT THAT. Sometimes, people just want to dance with friends, maybe in their own style. Take the no and leave, rather than forcing your body onto them.\n\nI get it. Rejection sucks. But more often than none, it's not just rejection: it's standing you're own ground, protecting your heart, or just trying to stay safe. So if someone says no, just be a decent human and respect the truth and walk away.",
