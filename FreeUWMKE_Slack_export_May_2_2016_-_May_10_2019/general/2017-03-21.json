Cook explained that thus far, the (RED) initiative&nbsp;has been very successful and the new iPhone 7 color variant will further lend to the growth of the effort:\n&ldquo;Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today&rsquo;s lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch,&rdquo; said Tim Cook, Apple&rsquo;s CEO.\n&ldquo;The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can&rsquo;t wait to get it into customers&rsquo; hands.&rdquo;\nIt&rsquo;s unclear how many PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7 units Apple plans to make. The device carries a &ldquo;Special Edition&rdquo; price tag and the company tells Mashable it plans to make &ldquo;a bunch&rdquo; of them:\nAs for supplies of the (RED) iPhone, Joswiak told us Apple plans to make &ldquo;a bunch,&rdquo; but wouldn&rsquo;t say how long they&rsquo;d be in market or exactly how many are available.\nFor those unfamiliar, Apple&rsquo;s (RED) partnership sees it donate a certain percentage of sales to the Global Fund to support HIV\/AIDS programs and help deliver an AIDS-free generation.\nIn addition&nbsp;to the new (RED) iPhone, Apple has also doubled the storage capacity for the iPhone SE. The device is now available in 32GB and 128GB models starting at $399. Finally, Apple has also announced new colors of its silicone and leather cases.
