The device was unveiled&nbsp;alongside a new iPad and a new social video editing app.\nApple made the announcement in a press release, which contained quotes from Tim Cook and offered up more details on the (RED) initiative.\n\nIn the&nbsp;press release, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained that (RED)&nbsp;gives customers an&nbsp;unprecedented way to contribute to the Global Fund for AIDS research. Cook explained that thus far, the (RED) initiative&nbsp;has been very successful and the new iPhone 7 color variant will further lend to the growth of the effort:\n&ldquo;Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today&rsquo;s lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch,&rdquo; said Tim Cook, Apple&rsquo;s CEO.\n&ldquo;The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can&rsquo;t wait to get it into customers&rsquo; hands.&rdquo;\nIt&rsquo;s unclear how many PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7 units Apple plans to make. The device carries a &ldquo;Special Edition&rdquo; price tag and the company tells Mashable it plans to make &ldquo;a bunch&rdquo; of them:\nAs for supplies of the (RED) iPhone, Joswiak told us Apple plans to make &ldquo;a bunch,&rdquo; but wouldn&rsquo;t say how long they&rsquo;d be in market or exactly how many are available.\nFor those unfamiliar, Apple&rsquo;s (RED) partnership sees it donate a certain percentage of sales to the Global Fund to support HIV\/AIDS programs and help deliver an AIDS-free generation.\nIn addition&nbsp;to the new (RED) iPhone, Apple has also doubled the storage capacity for the iPhone SE. The device is now available in 32GB and 128GB models starting at $399. Finally, Apple has also announced new colors of its silicone and leather cases. The silicone case is now available&nbsp;azure, camellia and pebble, while the&nbsp;leather case now comes in taupe, sapphire and berry.\n\nThe (RED) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in&nbsp;128GB and 256GB models starting at $749 from Apple&rsquo;s website and Apple&nbsp;retail stores. As of right now, the devices are listed as unavailable online but will go up for sale at 8:01AM PT\/11:01AM ET.

One hundred percent of all money raised by (RED) goes directly to Global Fund HIV\/AIDS grants that provide testing, counseling, treatment and prevention programs with a specific focus on eliminating transmission of the virus from moms to their babies. Since it was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone.\nPricing &amp; Availability\n&bull; iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition will be available in 128GB and 256GB models starting at $749 (US) from  and Apple Stores, and from Apple Authorized Resellers and select carriers (prices may vary).
