The majority (but obviously not all) of them came out of degree mills, hated each other due to regional issues (so they wouldn't speak to one another), would NEVER tell the truth, would creep out my female employees, and could only perform repetitive tasks.\n\nA story for you (I have more):\n\nI interviewed a guy over the phone who had a very slight accent, knew the answers to almost every technical question, and seemed like a great candidate. I contacted HR and we hired him.\n\nFast forward to the guy's first day:\n\nHe arrives and is totally unkempt, I greet him and realize that this guy can barely speak any English. I can not understand a word that he is saying and he obviously does not understand any of the technical terms being used for the next week.\n\nHe admitted two weeks later to a coworker (also Indian) that within the Indian community in the DC Metro area and elsewhere around the country, there are Indians that they pay to fill out resumes, do phone screens, and get paid for development when there are non repetitive tasks.\n\nLets not even talk about the pmp, cissp, ccna mills and the 'pay for someone to take your certification test' for you bs.\n\nIt sucks because there are actually some very smart Indians in this industry as well. My fellow program and project manager's and my overall experience has been very negative.\n```",
