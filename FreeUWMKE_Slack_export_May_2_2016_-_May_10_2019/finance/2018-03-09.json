So if the price on 4\/20 is like 174 bucks youve got some apple shares 9 bucks below what theyre going for.  \n\nNow im guessing you dont have $16,500 laying around so what youd actually be looking for is for apple to go to like ~163 in the next week or so.  Then you could sell your contract early to someone else for a nice premium.  So youd get some free money.",
